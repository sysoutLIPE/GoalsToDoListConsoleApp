This is my Goals To Do List Console App. I make this program to trainning my C#/.NET skills and to create a Goals list to me. I pretend to do all projects that i created(goals).
This program generates a .txt file with the project(goal) info each time when i chose to create a program.
A detail about this program is: To change the status of the program to "complete", it's necessary open the .txt file and change manually.
